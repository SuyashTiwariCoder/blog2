    <p>Much of the world’s business is now being done on the Internet with people using mobiles, tablets, or laptops looking for news, online shopping, video chats, office documentation, recipes, booking restaurants, reviews of school, locating doctors or even playing games.
        Our world has shrunk to the 6” inch screen allowing website development companies to multiplying and earn big money. For those looking to start their own website, learning HTML5 and CSS is a must. They are bread and butter for any developer.</p>

        <h2>What is CSS?

        </h2>

        <p>Cascading Style Sheets, as the name suggests is what adds style to your website. All those interesting fonts, slick colors and background images are all thanks to CSS. It affects the entire look and feel of the website making it an incredibly powerful tool for website developers to learn.</p>

        <h2>Save Money</h2>

        <p>There are a lot of web designers who will build your website or your CSS for you. But paying someone else to maintain your website or blog can get expensive, even if you only have them create the designs and you then maintain the content. Knowing how to modify the CSS will save you money when you find small problems that you can fix yourself. And as you practice, you'll be able to fix bigger and more complex problems.​</p>

        <h2>More Diverse Websites</h2>
        <img class="img"src="/img/umbrella-1588167.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p>CSS supports sites that look very different from page to page, without a lot of extensive coding. For example, many sites now perform slight color variations on the different sections of the site. Using page IDs, you can change the CSS for each section and use the same HTML structure for each section. The only thing that changes is the content and the CSS.</p>
        <h2>Easy To Learn </h2>
        <img class="img"src="/img/take-it-easy-3842473.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p>No, CSS is not hard to learn but studying code from others is a great way to learn. But don’t just read it, break it down until you understand it. There is nothing difficult to learn when you love to learn that. CSS, easy to learn but mastering is a little difficult.</p>
        <h2>Earn Money</h2>
        <img class="img"src="/img/woman-3972345.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p>Once you know how to design your website & how to design responsive website, you can easily start earning money out of it. And if you’re looking to become a freelance web designer, you won’t get far if you don’t know CSS.</p>
